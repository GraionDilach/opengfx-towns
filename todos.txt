lighthouse - add a function to only build it near sea
transmitter - add a function to only build it above a certain population

ukts house 5 - grab 5c from ogfx/buildings.png:549 and grab a second roof for a d variant

ukts house 9 - grab 9c from ogfx/buildings.png:645 and grab a second roof for a d variant

radio station - move remap, snow frame, ground sprites (maybe a fence?)
boiler station - rescale building to fit into a cell
