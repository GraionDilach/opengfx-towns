comment out duplicate frames and let OpenTTD automatically handle constuction states?

Review and clear up all GROUNDSPRITE_CLEARED instances - tile edges leak through on 32bpp extra zoom as a contour and putting CLEARED under a complete building instead of the terrain's native tile is more blatantly visible

expand UKTS ground tiles with desert variants

lighthouse - add a function to only build it near sea
transmitter - add a function to only build it above a certain population

ukts house 5 - grab 5c from ogfx/buildings.png:549 and grab a second roof for a d variant

ukts house 10 - eanble uncommented variant and grab a second roof for a d variant
ukts house 13 - enable uncommented variant and grab a second roof for a d variant
ukts house 16 - slap a second roof on UKTS variant and grab ogfx/buildings.png:848

ukts offices 1 - recolor ew sprite to be a copy of ogfx 1425, code result in as cosmetic?

boiler station - rescale building to fit into a cell
